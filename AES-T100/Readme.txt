Trojan Description
	The Trojan leaks the secret key from a cryptographic chip running the AES algorithm through a covert channel. 
	The channel adapts the concepts from spread spectrum communications (also known as Code-Division Multiple Access (CDMA)) 
	to distribute the leakage of single bits over many clock cycles. The Trojan employs this method by using 
	a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) to create a CDMA code sequence, the PRNG initialized to a predefined value. 
	The code sequence is then used to XOR modulate the secret information bits. The modulated sequence is forwarded to 
	a leakage circuit (LC) to set up a covert CDMA channel in the power side-channel. The LC is realized by connecting 
	eight identical flip-flop elements to the single output of the XOR gate to mimic a large capacitance [1].
